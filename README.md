The Clicker Challenge

A fast-paced 2D reaction shooter game built with Python, Tkinter, and Pygame.  
Players must click on moving targets before time runs out — with multiple levels, adaptive difficulty, and a built-in leaderboard system.
Overview

The Clicker Challenge was created as a final project for CS 108: Introduction to Computer Science (Fall 2024).  
The game blends GUI programming and event-driven logic to deliver an engaging test of reflex and precision.

Features

Four Difficulty Levels — Easy, Medium, Hard, and Impossible (X mode).  
Dynamic Music System — background tracks and click sound effects using `pygame.mixer`.  
Leaderboard — automatically updates each player’s top score per level.  
User System — allows name input and personalized score tracking.  
Responsive UI — game built entirely in Tkinter with smooth transitions and loading animations.
